# zig-http
A basic HTTP server built in Zig (for learning purposes).

Currently implements the `GET` method and is enough to host basic static websites.

## Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:peterc-s/zig-http` or `git clone https://github.com/peterc-s/zig-http`.
2. `cd zig-http`
3. Use `zig build run` to build and run.

## TODO
- [ ] Allow changing port with command line argument.
- [ ] Check `GET` implementation is up to specification.
- [ ] Implement other HTTP methods.
- [ ] Implement HTTP versions.
- [ ] Refactor code.
